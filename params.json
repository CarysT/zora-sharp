Inspired by the [original password generator](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nqkrp95gvs223re/ZeldaPasswords.exe) written by Paulygon back in 2001.\r\n\r\nCurrent feature list:\r\n\r\n * Can decode game, ring, and memory secrets\r\n * Allows the user to save the decoded game information for later use\r\n\r\nPlanned features:\r\n\r\n * Ability to generate codes\r\n * Include a debugging screen to get raw information about secrets\r\n * Finish GTK interface for Linux users\r\n\r\n### Current Problems\r\n\r\nRight now the biggest problem preventing me from generating codes is the checksum used at the end of each code. Information on what is known so far is available in the docs folder.\r\n\r\n### Special Thanks\r\n\r\nA big thanks to 39ster over at [GameFAQs](http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/472313-the-legend-of-zelda-oracle-of-ages/66934363) for figuring out how to decode the game secrets. I was able to expand his work to include ring secrets and memory secrets as well.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
